# Introduction

This is a web application that allows you to to search for albums and artists, view their information, and rate albums.
Powered by Vite + React, MUI, and [Last.fm's](https://www.last.fm/) API.

Note: Last\.fm's API does not provide artist's images, they only provide album cover art, which is why the search page for artists is stripped down.

# How to run it

- Clone
- Install dependencies using npm install.
- Set up environment variables: Port, JWT secret, and your Last\.fm API key (variable names in the code might change based on what you're using to create your React app).
- If you're using Vite, use npm run dev in the frontend, otherwise just run it normally.
